⏰ Bharat Clock:
Bharat Clock is a simple React application that displays the current date and time in India. The app is built using React and styled with Bootstrap to ensure a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. It consists of three main components:
ClockHeading: Displays the app title, “Bharat Clock”.
ClockSlogan: Shows a descriptive tagline highlighting the purpose of the app.
CurrentTime: Displays the live date and time, updating every second using React Hooks (useState and useEffect).
The live clock feature ensures that the time shown is always accurate, and the app automatically re-renders every second to keep the display up to date. The UI is centered and uses Bootstrap classes for proper spacing, making it visually appealing across different devices.

Real-time clock that updates every second.
Clean and responsive design using Bootstrap.
Easy to install and run locally.
